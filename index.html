<!--Changed the div class to just header for semantic property, same thing with nav and div. Changed the 
class to id for seo, needed to put a # if front of seo in CSS page to be able to change it from a class to id.
Changed the CSS header div to header nav so it was able to add the margin correctly in a semantic format. -->

    Changed the div to nav on the HTML side, I then took the period off of hero and switched it with the 
# so that I was able to use id instead of class-->

            <h2>Online Reputation Management</h2>
            <p>
                The web is full of opinions, and some of these can be negative. Social media allows anyone with an internet connection to say whatever they want about your business. Online Reputation Management gives you the control over what potential customers see when they search for your business.

<!-- Since this subset of code contains most of the content of the page, I decided to change the div to 
main. Again, I switched out the other divs for navs to how the navigation through the page. I added the 
photo comments to this with the alt tag, so that people are aware of what the photo is if they are impaired
or there is an issue with the link.-->

    <!--Changed the h2 on the footer to h4 to go in correct order. I changed the div class 
        footer to just footer for semantic format. It looked like the footer 
        in the mockup didn't display the text in the footer, so I put display=none 
        in the CSS sheet.-->
